# Score Attack Plugin

This plugin is built off [CommonAPI](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI) and [CommonAPI-Sample](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI-Sample). I take absolutely no credit for the work.
Special thanks to NotNite, Yuri, and SpecialFX for inspiration, programming, and testing.


## Building

Make sure you have a `BRCPath` environment variable defined on your system, which points to the root folder of your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk installation. This way the project can find the required DLLs.
