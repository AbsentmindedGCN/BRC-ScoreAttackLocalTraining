# Score Attack Offline Plugin
 
This plugin is built off [CommonAPI](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI) and [CommonAPI-Sample](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI-Sample). I take absolutely no credit for the work.

Special thanks to NotNite, Yuri, and SpecialFX for inspiration, programming, and testing. This code could (and probably should) be cleaned up a lot. This is my first BepInEx plugin and I'm getting back into coding, so I apologize for any mistakes/oversights. If you have any suggestions for the plugin or coding tips, please let me know!

## Building

This requires [CommonAPI](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI). Make sure you put that in your 'libs' folder in the directory you have your files. Make sure you have a `BRCPath` environment variable defined on your system, which points to the root folder of your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk installation as well. This way the project can find the required DLLs.
